# A.I.DA
Project work for Foundations of Artificial Intelligence - MSc Computer Engineering (University of Bologna)

Named after Giuseppe Verdi's opera, A.I.DA is a Java-based genetic algorithm that produces monophonic music.
Among other parameters, the user can choose the length of the samples, the mapping from genotype to phenotype by means of a scale (i.e. C Major, etc.), and the note range.

The best results were obtained with a Pentatonic C Major scale, 16 notes per sample, and 6 as the note range.

In [/report](https://github.com/ilceltico/aida/tree/master/report) there is a PowerPoint with audio samples, an explanation of what happens in A.I.DA, the UML diagram and the references. There is also a PDF version of the presentation.

More results can be found in [/results](https://github.com/ilceltico/aida/tree/master/results).


This work has been inspired by Prof. John Biles, whose work on music can be found [here](https://genjam.org).
This paper in particular has been very useful: [Biles, John. (1994). GenJam: A Genetic Algorithm for Generating Jazz Solos](https://genjamorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bilesicmc94.pdf).
